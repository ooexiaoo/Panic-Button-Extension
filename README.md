# Panic-Button-Extension

The panic button extension is a simple extension that lets you hide your chrome based window that you're using with a simple shortcut button. I've used "CTRL+SHIFT+K". This will minimize your current chrome window and open a safe window that you've selected from the input menu.

## Input Option
Go to extension options. You'll get an input option to enter your safe website. Do remember to use "http://"" or "https://" without it the extension will give an error.
